#This is the shell script that teaches the usage of 'set' command
set Youtube is best website on web
echo $*

#here we can also use $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6 which would be holding the values 'Youtube','is','best','website','on','web'
#$* prints all the variables.This way, we can set the shell variables!
